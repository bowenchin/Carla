# Carla-Android
A simple Android application that interfaces with Arduino's BT serial that communicates with nearby Bluetooth beacons to implement indoor positioning. This was developed during MEMSI June 2017.

This project uses Bluetooth beacons and receivers to implement indoor positioning. The idea is that we can track a person's activity and routine around the house. For our proof-of-concept prototype, we used the signal strength between the beacon and Bluetooth receiver to determimne distance and count the number of times the person is in-range as the activity measurement.
